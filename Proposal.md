# Final Project 12: Useless Bug Swatter

## Description: 
This game is will showcase image of a bug, will randomly pop at differnt location, and move at a random speed. This is relvent to digital arts & media because it is a small fun game where the players has to click the red box in order to destroy it. As the player succeed in destorying the red boxes, the level of difficulty will increase in which will challenge and encourage them to proceed.

note: I will be rephrasing from bug to red box for a better understanding and visualization.

## Features:
* In order to destory the red box, the users will have to use the mouse to drag the cursor icon, and use the left button to destory the red box. Which will be mainly used in pygame library function.
* Using the random fuction from python library, the red box will randomly place at different location.
* The red box will have the fade function that will limit the amoment of time exposed on the window
* Have the count feature that lets the users know how many red boxes.
* The mouse cusror control will be shaped as a green dot 

## Challenge:
I plan to find some of the tutorial that offer an examples, and and would learn how to run the game

* There will be the expected difficulty in coding on how to make interactive red box that pops up random, and move randomly anf fade out when time runs out.

## Outcome:
The ideal outcome will be fun and challenging for players to use bug swatter game. Will meet the 'retro' game standard will make it more appealing. 

The minimal outcome is that it should be able to red box functionally works well. If it did, I will be able to modify, and upgrade teh visual effects to make it more attracting. 

## Milestones:
My first goal is to gain much information related to mouse button and cursor control cursor, and focus on creating a interaction red box

Second Goal is that if the first goal are perfectly smooth and fixed in schedule, I would add appealing visual arts to attract and improve the conncection between the game and the player.
